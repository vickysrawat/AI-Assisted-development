description: Answers codebase questions primarily from architecture docs and the codebase knowledge graph. Will optionally read ONE source file with explicit consent (Category B) when structural docs don't contain the answer. Saves hundreds of tokens vs scanning src/. Tells you exactly which file to look at for deeper detail.
argument-hint: "<question about the codebase>"

## Model routing

This command uses the **infrastructure tier** — `INFRA_MODEL`
(default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`).

To override: `{{ "env": {{ "INFRA_MODEL": "claude-opus-4-6" }} }}` in `.claude/settings.json`.
See `skills/shared/model-routing-spec.md` for the full specification.

# /explain — Codebase Q&A without source scanning

Answers structural questions about the codebase using only `.claude/architecture/`
docs. No source scanning. Instant, low-cost answers for "how does X work" and
"where is Y handled" questions.

If the architecture docs don't contain enough to answer fully, the command tells
you exactly which one file to look at — and only that file.

---

## Step 1 — Parse the question

Extract the question from the invocation arguments.

If no question was provided:
```
Ask a question about the codebase:
  /explain "How does Azure AD auth flow through the API layer?"
  /explain "Where are matter filters applied?"
  /explain "What pattern do we use for error handling?"
```

---

## Step 2 — Load architecture context (always, never skip)

```bash
cat .claude/architecture/architecture.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_ARCH_DOCS"
cat .claude/graph/graph-index.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_GRAPH"
```

Also load any additional architecture files present:
```bash
ls .claude/architecture/*.md 2>/dev/null
```
Read each one found (they are small).

If `NO_ARCH_DOCS` and `NO_GRAPH`:
```
⚠ No architecture docs or knowledge graph found.
Run /dream-init to generate them — /explain relies on these to answer without scanning source.
```
And stop.

---

## Step 3 — Answer from architecture docs

Attempt to answer the question using only the architecture context loaded in Step 2.

**Answer format:**

```
{Direct answer to the question — 2–5 sentences.
 Reference layer names, patterns, and file names from the architecture docs.
 Do not invent details not present in the docs.}

Relevant module: {Module from graph-index}
Entry point    : {path/to/EntryFile from the module detail file}
Key files      : {list from the module detail file, if relevant}
```

---

## Step 4 — Decide whether source is needed

After answering from architecture docs, assess confidence:

**HIGH confidence** (answer is complete from docs):
- State the answer
- List the relevant files from the module detail file for reference
- Do not open any source files

**MEDIUM confidence** (partial answer, one file would clarify):
- State what is known from the docs
- Identify the ONE file most likely to contain the missing detail
- Ask:
  ```
  The architecture docs give a partial answer. To be precise,
  I'd need to read: {file}
  Shall I read it? (yes / no)
  ```
- Only read that file if the developer confirms

**LOW confidence** (question is too specific for architecture docs):
- State what is known
- Name the 1–2 most relevant files from the module detail file
- Say:
  ```
  This is too specific for the architecture docs.
  The most likely place to look: {file}
  Run /explain after reading it yourself, or say "yes" and I'll read {file}.
  ```

---

## Step 5 — If developer says yes to reading a file

Read exactly ONE file. Answer the question from its content.

```
{Precise answer now that the source has been read}

Source: {file}:{line range if applicable}
```

Do not read additional files unless the developer explicitly asks.

---

## Hard Rules

This command follows `skills/shared/source-file-consent.md` Category B.
The gate in Step 4 is the implementation of that spec.

- NEVER scan `src/` or any directory without an explicit developer confirmation in Step 4
- NEVER read more than ONE source file per /explain invocation
- NEVER say "I don't have access to the source code" — the architecture docs were built
  from the source and contain the structural answer for most questions
- If the knowledge graph is stale (`.claude/graph/.stale` present), note it:
  ```
  ⚠ the knowledge graph may be stale — run /graph-sync for a fresh answer
  ```
  Then answer with what is available
